##### Key Features:
Real-time data fetching with Alpha Vantage API.
Comprehensive EDA to understand market trends and patterns.
Predictive models include Linear Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM.
Flask-based web app for user interaction and easy access to predictions

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Source: Alpha Vantage API provides daily stock data.
Data Format: Data is fetched as a CSV file and stored locally.
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Created new features such as:
    Moving Averages (simple and exponential)
    Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
Data Normalization: Scaled data to a common range for optimal model performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to gain insights into stock behavior:
Trend Visualization: Plotted stock prices over time.
Volatility Analysis: Used Bollinger Bands to assess price fluctuations.
Technical Indicators: Analyzed RSI, MACD, and other indicators to understand market sentiment.
Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between features and stock prices.

## Predictive Modeling
Several predictive models were implemented:
Linear Regression: Baseline model to establish linear relationships.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Deep learning model capturing sequential dependencies in time series.
ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): Statistical model for time series forecasting.

## Model Evaluation and Optimization
Models were evaluated using:
Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Optimization Techniques:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusted layers, neurons, and learning rates.
Cross-Validation: Split dataset into multiple folds for better generalization.
Regularization: Used L1/L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.

## Deployment with Flask
The model was deployed as a web application using Flask. Users can input a stock ticker and receive predictions.
Set Up the Environment:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create Application Files:

app.py: Main application file.

index.html: HTML template for the web interface.

Run the Application:
python app.py

Access the app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## Tools and Technologies
Python: Data processing and modeling.

Alpha Vantage API: Stock market data source.

Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning models.

TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning models (e.g., LSTM).

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizations.

Flask: Web app deployment.

## Conclusion
This project presents a full cycle of stock price prediction using machine learning, from data collection to deployment. The models provide promising results, but continued tuning and experimentation may improve accuracy.

## Future Work
To further enhance the model and application:

Integrate Additional APIs: Consider using other sources for more comprehensive data.
Extend Model Variety: Experiment with additional time series models.
Improve User Interface: Enhance the web app with frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js for a more dynamic experience.
